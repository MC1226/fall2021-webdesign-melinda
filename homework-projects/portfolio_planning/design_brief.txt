I will be using the following colors for my Color Scheme:
Tan
Black
Royal Blue
Hot pink
Golden Yellow
because I looked to see how they work together and the color coordination works.
The font I will use will be:
Caramel/Carattere, Architects Daughter/Carattere
Alex Brush/Bonheur Royale, Bonheur Royale/Architects Daughter, Bonheur Royale/Roboto, Bonheur Royale/Allura
because all of these combinations pair well.
So far, I will be using the Microsoft Office icon, a computer icon
