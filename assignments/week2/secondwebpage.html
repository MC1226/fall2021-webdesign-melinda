<h1>My Second Webpage</h1>

<p>San Francisco is one of my favorite cities. Below are a few pictures of the city and the sea lions basking in the sun at Pier 39.</p>

    <!-- This is NOT how you make an image element!-->
    <!-- <img>myimage.jpg</img> -->

    <!-- This is the CORRECT way of making an image element! -->
    <!-- img is a SELF-CLOSING tag, it has no closing tag it closes itself! -->
    <!-- src is an attribute, attributes are ADDITIONAL pieces of information for an element. Attributes can ONLY go inside of the OPENING tag. -->

    <!-- Example of a good alt description. -->
    <img src="images/pexels-eric-thurber-3688579 (1).jpg" alt="SF City Night View" title="SF City Night View" />
    <p>San Francisco City Night View</p>
     
    <!-- Example of a bad alt description. The description is describing the FILE and not the CONTENT of the file. -->
    <img src="images/pexels-belle-co-345750 (1).jpg" alt="Golden Gate Bridge" title="Waters edge at Golden Gate Bridge" />
    <p>Waters edge at Golden Gate Bridge</p>
    
    <!--Example of a bad alt description. The description is assuming or suggesting something not related to the image. -->
    <img src="images/pexels-brian-hackworth-5872482.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Sea Lions at Pier 39." title="Sea Lions at Pier 39." />
    <p>I was told that the male sea lions come to Pier 39 to get away from the female sea lions.</p>
