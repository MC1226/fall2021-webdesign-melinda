    <h1>"HTML"</h1>
     
    
        <p>Summary: The goal of the website is to teach what HTML & HTML5 are, what it looks like, how to create and view HTML, which file extensions are used with HTML and is HTML a programming language. It was helpful but felt like it could've elaborated more about HTML in the actual web page but the resources below were even more helpful because it contained related pages regarding How to start in HTML and Web design, Extended special HTML characters and codes, Programming language history, also HTML and Web design help and support. All in all, it was an okay website for someone barely starting off that doesn't know HTML but I will say is that I learned who it was that first developed HTML, it was developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990. This is free online for anyone to access. I'm not sure that this article has been used by other companies.</p>

    <h1>"JavaScript for Cats"</h1>
      
                
        <p>Summary: This web page is an introduction for new programmers. The author of this webpage, Max Ogden makes JavaScript very easy to understand and learn. I like the fact that he has moving commands that show the commands in gif form for each subject he is talking about such as The console, Strings, Values and variables, Using functions, Built in JS functions, Downloading new fuctions, Loops, Arrays, Objects, Callbacks which is very helpful. 
        <br>

        <br>
        He shows you how to get interactive in his webpage by having you open up a Console/Terminal straight from his webpage and can be done on any website and gives you commands to type and while you're entering the info his gif shows you how to do it the right way and what happens if you do it the wrong way. It's very interactive. He teaches you the basics and helps you understand it in simple terms, not complicated at all, he makes you want to learn and makes you want to keep reading because he's funny the way he uses cat references, along with cat images throughout his webpage and makes it enjoyable to read. 
        <br>

        <br>
        Towards the end the author puts a link to his github so if anyone wants to see any other topic covered they can open an issue on his github and he will cover that issue. I like the fact that at the end he lists books, ebooks and guides as resources including a link to NodeSchool that he helped create. NodeSchool <q>is an open source project run by volunteers with two goals: to create high quality programming curriculum and to host community learning events.</q> I liked the author's sense of humor, at one point in the webpage he put an Author's note that said: <q> I @maxogden do happily accept random cat photo tweets.</q> I really found the web page very useful and enjoyed it very much. I'm sure that anyone who reads it will find it useful as well. It is available to everyone and his goal is to teach everyone that beginning JavaScript is obtainable. I'm not sure if companies have used this web page but it would be very helpful if a company was to utilize it.</p>
